AlgoScore
=========
By Jonatan Liljedahl <lijon@kymatica.com>

Algoscore is a graphical environment for algorithmic composition,
where music is constructed directly in an interactive graphical score.

For full documentation, see the AlgoScore Users Guide at
https://raboof.github.io/AlgoScore/algoscore-manual.html

AlgoScore is released under the GNU General Public License v3 or later,
see COPYING for more information.

To build AlgoScore, follow these steps:

$ cd src
$ ./make_build

dependencies:

- CMake (build dependency only)
- JACK 0.100.x (0.102.27 or later for MIDI support)
- csound 5
- libsndfile 1.0
- GTK+ 2.8
- GLib 2.12
- PCRE (optional)
- LibLO (optional, for OSC support)

On Debian, try "apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev libcsound64-dev libsndfile1-dev"

There's no need to 'install' AlgoScore, it's a self-contained application
directory. Start AlgoScore by running the AppRun script, or running the
algoscore binary from within the top-level directory of the AlgoScore folder.

If you're using ROX-Filer, you should just be able to start the AppDir by
double-clicking it, and AlgoScore will try to compile itself if no binary
existed already.
