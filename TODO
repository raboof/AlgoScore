Those are my quite personal and non-ordered notes about bug fixes, improvements
and new features to add. Some are in swedish...

GDB: handle SIG33 nostop noprint pass

* Canvas rewrite, think about using existing cairo canvas:
  GooCanvas, CrCanvas or CcCanvas. GooCanvas seems nice...
  Or learn how they do it and make my own?
  Then we have fast pointertest and could highlight objects at mouse-over,
  also graphical zoom, simple event handling since the items are GObjects,
  stacking, etc...
  Use a CanvasGroup per object and then use canvas items for the drawing?
  Or use cairo directly in a custom item, perhaps drawing on a cache surface?
  (We could make a GooCanvasItemSurface that displays a cairo surface)
  When timezooming all objects need to update and redraw themselves.
  Also clip to scroll-region when zoomed in? GDK window size limit could be
  a problem, and cairos 16bit limit...
  Currently we don't actually draw anything that isn't on the screen, and
  scrolling just changes what part of the objects should be drawn (that's
  why it's a bit slow)..
  Does GooCanvasItems check visible scroll region when drawing paths or does
  it leave it up to cairo to do the clipping?
  
  To summarize, the problem is that our objects can be extremely long..
  A 45 minute long object and a timezoom of 200px per second means
  540,000 pixels. We can't have this big image surfaces? Does GooCanvas
  handle such big items? Does GooCanvas handle such big canvas?
  We need a way to let objects draw only their visible part (or a couple
  of screen-widths around this part).
  The paint method gets a GooCanvasBounds argument for this.
  This seems to be solvable, see demo-large-items.c...
  
  Moving complex objects in GooCanvas is slow, we need a cache.
  Perhaps just render that part of canvas to image surface when dragging
  starts and then paint this image until dragging stops.
  (It would be nice with a function to render just a single item so we don't
  get the background in the moving image.) Actually we need to render one
  screen-width more, so that unvisible part of object can be shown when
  moved into visible part of canvas...
  
  I'd like to have an item that draws a cairo surface, which objects can
  use to draw on (much like it works today). But this surface should only
  be as big as the visible area (or a couple of screenwidths), so the object
  needs to know when to just paint the cached surface and when to redraw
  on this surface (when new parts of the objects comes into the visible area).
  It seems the only time it needs to paint the cached surface is when
  moving the object around... So we might set a flag that it's moving,
  which are checked by the paint method. But then we might as well paint
  directly to the canvas when this flag is not set. So...
  At move_start, set item->moving
  At move_end, unset item->moving
  At paint method:
    - if item->moving is set and item->cache_surface is null, create
      item->cache_surface and redraw on this.
    - if item->moving is unset and item->cache_surface exists, free it.
    - if item->cache_surface is null, redraw on canvas
    - else paint cache_surface
  But we need to take care of which part of the object that is visible,
  perhaps simply allow the surface to be screen_size*2?
  
  bounding box sent to paint method is for whole canvas, need to clip
  to item and convert to item units
  
  if cache, need to keep track of what part we have cached and update it
  if it changes
  
  How to solve sticky objects and textlabels that keep themselves visible
  when scrolling past them? It's easy, just hook to the scroll signal and
  move the objects.

* non-time-bound sequences:
  sometimes there's a need for sequences that are not bound to time.
  either they are manually composed, or generated.
  manual sequences is mostly done with 'code' objects, as a list in
  a single event at time 0.
  a generated one could be from a randomizer, where each time we
  ask for a value we want a randomized one... for example a markow chain.
  it would be nice if this worked with get_value() (ignoring t), so that
  each time a target object asks for a value we get the next value in the
  sequence.  this would need the source obj to know when to reset/seed.
  each target obj should signal such a reset to the source when they
  start collecting values (in generate()). objects that does on-the-fly
  passing of values like funcbus would pass on also the reset signal..
  could this be done in Inlet.get_connections() or similar?
  also, get_event() might get them by index..
  another approach for such a markow chain would be to have a "size"
  property and let it pre-generate all data and put them out either as
  numbered events or as a list in a single event...
  think about common types and object compatibility, etc...
  maybe we could support all three methods?

* Make a cached Inlet.event_finder()? (see FuncBus.get_event())

* Export doesn't work without JACK client

* put outs in datagen in 'out' hash, like out.out1, with code to be
  compatible if out was used as an output? (if out contains a vector
  named 'data', use compatibility mode)

* direct access to csound DSP graph? then subparts of an instrument could
  be connected in the score.. like envelopes and oscillator, etc..
  Or pair graphical symbols with csound instr snippets?

* Put filename in Score class and current score in globals.

* See if there are more places that could benefit from using
  g_idle_add() to do stuff in the mainloop instead of in other threads..
  (all GUI stuff for example, maybe the csound print buffer, etc?)

* check file format somehow... for example grep for "score.new_obj"?

* EvGraph parameter map property could be nasal expression so that one
  can use any part of the input data and also constants, etc..
  { y_pos: x[2],
    dur: x[1],
    color: x[0],
    size: x[3],
    black: 0.5 }
    
* Morph object:
  - Connecting a previous obj to A makes sense, so maybe we should stop
    drawing out-of-time connections as red? Draw as arc or spline?
  - pass a "path" arg to interpolating function
  - how to handle get_event()?
  - how to handle vectors of different length?
  - other vector transformations: shift, substitute, etc.. (see KyCE-II)

* sometimes it disconnects from JACK:
  "cannot complete execution of the processing graph (Resource temporarily unavailable)
  zombified - calling shutdown handler", sometimes crashing jackd and/or qjackctl.

replace subvec(x,1) with x[1:]
replace t = ev[0]; v = ev[1] with (t,v) = ev;

* if generate() returned error, abort the update-chain so we don't have to see
  all the successive errors happening because of the first. best would be if
  we could just not update all objects depending on the one who got an error,
  so if multiple chains are updated in update_all we don't abort every update...?
  done now in ASObject.update(), but what to do in Score.update_all()?

* better JACK transport support:
  - Test sync with ardour, recording an impulse
  - can we set play_pos to pos.frame from jack_transport_query()?
    perhaps it should be pos.frame+nframes?
  - register slow sync callback?
  - allow AS to be slaved if other client does start/stop/locate
  - we need to let playpos_monitor interval proc run all the time?
  - need to use jack transport state in OSC to be in sync with jack,
    and don't stop in signal wait if transport is JackTransportStarting,
    or call signal_osc_thread() in process()? since we don't know how long
    to sleep if JackTransportStarting...
  - need to think about all different places of play states, currently there
    is jack_transport_query(), playing in C and play_state in nasal...
    same thing with play position.

* When changing object height, make room if it collides with other objs?

* A score.unhold_update() (like after a move start but where the object didn't
  actually move) restarts any generate threads in progress,
  this shouldn't happen. even if pending_update is 1 it should not cancel and
  update if it's already working. only if anything actually changed so that
  it *needs* to be restarted.
  A maybe-fix is to set pending_update=2 while working, and check for this
  in score.update_all().. but the right thing should probably be to
  see if any obj in group actually changed. tried this in score.unhold_update
  but it didn't work: when a change actually happened the objects where not
  updated but only set pending update on them (???)

* We should check/handle outlet-inlet type mismatch. Like print a warning
  and use default value instead. Don't remove the connection, since one
  might add a transfunc that converts it to a proper value. But it would
  be nice to draw it as "inactive"...

* OSC bus:
  - try to make it run without JACK? means we will have to update play_pos, etc..
    but it should sync with JACK transport if present...
  - use realtime sched on osc thread?

* Change math.mod() behaviour back to original nasal (and python),
  but needs fixing of timegrid drawing in score_ui.nas

* C Objects. export methods for init(), draw(), etc..
  Pass them a CObject ghost. Wrap in ASObject, like
  class.init = func(o) o.cobj = module.init(o);
  class.draw = func module.draw(me.cobj,arg);

* GUI edit for:
  - linseg insert/remove/move nodes
  - jitter min/max dur (left/right), min/max value (up/down), start/end value

* pagemarks should be deletable

* split object at locate-cursor, handler in each class decides how to do it.
  The default one just divides the object (copy and adjust length and start)

* jitter->linseg freeze?

* 'environment code', a piece of code that is saved with the project and can
  be edited by the user. After editing this code, do:

    ns=new_nasal_env();
    ns.math=math;
    environ=compile(code);
    call(environ,nil,nil,ns);
    score.nasal_env = ns;

  then each time we compile usercode (code objects, transfer functions,
  randomizers, nasal cmdline, etc..) we do:

    code=bind(code,score.nasal_env);

  and then evaluate it with private namespace as usual:
    
    ns={my_local:42,foo:123}; # local variable namespace
    call(code,nil,nil,ns,err);

  this environment can thus be used to define custom functions and stuff like
  that.

* controlrate output from csoundbus, for analysis etc.. problem is that
  outbusses use background thread, so any dependant obj would need to postpone
  their update until the bus is done.. one way would be to create a function
  that does the rest of the updates and pass it to the bus to be called
  when done...

* amplitude and sonogram plots on audiobusses (csound and soundfile)?

* brownian motion:
  - gendyn-like class (N repeating breakpoints)
  - jitter where t and/or y is relative last point (can now be done with
    the randomizer properties)

* ladspa plugin support: possibility to apply plugs on busses before playback
  and export. For GUI realtime control of sound mix (mastering).
  Controllable through ladspa_ctrl object/bus.
  perhaps even possibility to use csound as plugs?
  or should this be part of the score? (so that you connect a csound bus
  to a ladspa bus, etc..)
  Needs to be flexible, perhaps a patch editor where you connect busses
  to plugs, and plugs to jack output ports. maybe we should have a static
  set of N jack output ports?

* move surf cache stuff from score_ui to ASObject.paint and other methods,
  so that each obj does their own (optional) caching and has the ability
  to draw outside their frame.
  Then stuff like TextBus can draw the textbox above the busline, draw
  connections to the busline (not the textbox) but highlight and react on
  mouse drags on both busline and textbox, etc..
  And ASPlotObj can draw value labels to the left of their start pos.

  But we still need to be able to know the actual graphic boundaries of
  objects, (for auto-aligning page output when exporting to PDF) which
  might not be the "active" region in terms of user interface
  (.xy_inside_obj() and .highlight()) or the positioning of connection
  arrows. Perhaps we can use cairo_path_extents()?
  
  So, what we have is .start defining the actual start time,
  and .xpos .ypos .width .height to define the graphic boundaries.
  An obj needs to be able to set their .xpos themselfes, default is
  time2x(start) but it might be time2x(start)-xofs if the obj draws
  anything before it's start time.
  
  Then we have .xy_inside_obj() to get the active clicking region..
  
  How should we handle connections?
  Perhaps .get_con_in_ypos(x) and .get_con_out_ypos(x) methods?
  
  Need to think about update_geom(), pre-paint, paint.. an obj needs to
  know when it changes graphical size in case of surf cache.

* (samma som ovan?) ta bort att objekt ritar på individuell cachad surface och
  låt dem istället rita
  direkt på en av två skärmbreda surfaces?? då kan de rita hur de vill...
  nackdelen är att när man flyttar objekt så måste _alla_ synliga objekt rita om
  sig själva.. kan lösas genom att man låter alla andra obj rita på screen surf
  en gång och sen paintar man bara detta och ritar moving-object ovanpå?
  ofs och width args till obj.draw() visar då vilken del av objektet som faktiskt
  behöver ritas. döp om till ofs och end?

* Layers: let all objects have a 'layer' property, and make a layer-window
  where the current layer is choosen, layers can be created, their
  visibility toggled on/off, etc.. can be useful for printing, and later for
  keeping track of script-generated parts of the score.
  In the future also 'select all in layer' for deletion, changing properties,
  moving, etc..
  Or perhaps better, use the concept of 'tags' instead of layers?

* Also allow objects to be overlaid, for example to show multiple curves
  on the same graphical area? Then we need a simple way to select which layer
  we work in, perhaps dimming the other layers. Or some clever layer-scroll
  mode, like holding a key while dragging the mouse to select which object
  in a stack that is on top and sensitive to user events, the non-selected
  objects could be dimmed while doing this (while holding down the key).

  This should probably not be the same layer/tags system as mentioned
  previously. This is more a concept of stacking objects, and exactly what
  number each obj in a stack has is not important.
  
  One could also have two keys to rotate the stack, dimming the non-top
  objects a second after this. and a third key to activate the dimming again
  (without rotating the stack) or a global toggle to enable/disable constant
  dimming of non-top objects...
  
  Each obj in a stack shares an ordered stacklist. vector or hash?
  if(obj.stack!=nil and obj!=obj.stack[0]) dim()...
  Each time we create, remove or move an obj we need to check if it left
  its current stack and if it should be added to another.
  
  Stacking could also be non-automatic, perhaps this is easier. A 'stack'
  action lets the user drag one object to another, it will then get the
  same ypos and create a stacklist or add to the existing one.
  vertically moving any obj in a stack moves all objs.
  
  There's also problems with knowing which connections that goes to what
  object in a stack, etc.. but this could be solved by showing the object ID
  in the inlet/outlet label at the connection arrow.

* Is it possible to make AS start even without jack and/or csound but at least
  show a dialog about the missing lib? Even better if it could be usable
  anyway, as in weak linking.
  what about dummy libraries that are found as a fallback if the libs
  was not found?
  what about a test binary that is run from a script before starting AS?
  what about running ldd or otool to find missing symbols?
  A last resort would be to use dlopen...

* signal_bus:
  - multiple channels? would be great if they could name the ports too, but
    setup_ports() only enumerates them with a single integer.
  
* make generic code for background rendering thread handling? to be used
  in both csound and signal busses... (also think about possibility to run
  *all* obj update in bg threads...)

* Mac OS X build:
    osascript -l AppleScript -e 'tell Application "Finder" to display dialog "Call Frank" '
    osascript -l AppleScript -e 'tell Application "Finder" to display alert "Call Frank" '

  - try weak linking csound.
  
  - try to discover why AS is not so stable on OS X, it sometimes crashes
    or freezes...
  
  - on some machines there are system-beeps when anything is printed on the
    algoscore console! why?

  - Need to have other key-mouse bindings since Mac as 1-button standard
    and alt and cmd is used for 3-button emulation.. Perhaps use cmd-click
    for button3?

  - Try to build universal binary

  - To move focus with the mouse pointer:
      defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_ffm true
    To pass through the focus click:
      defaults write com.apple.x11 wm_click_through -bool true

* Put a 'description' field in each property, inlet and outlet?
  Then we can generate documentation for each class...
  Fix escaping of special chars when extracting class descriptions..

* move propbox code evaluation to ASObject? then it's easier to set up
  the namespace so it could have math, G_get/G_set, me.get_prop, etc..
  if all objs has 'aux inlets' prop, it could even have access to these..
  Do the evaluation in get instead of set, so it will always be updated.
  This means all props will be strings of nasal code! Note that this needs
  all usage of props use me.get_prop(name) instead of me.name! we should then
  probably put the string-values (and compiled expressions!) in me.properties
  instead of in the object.

  Also categories like "appearance" and "parameters" for tabbed notebook,
  (even graphical editors and text-editor could be placed in their tabs.)
  This is a good change since it will clean up things and not pollute the
  objects symboltable..
  
  perhaps make Property class? or Properties?
  a Property class should contain get(), get_string(), set() methods..
  and a callback.
  get = func nil;
  set = func(val) {
    me.string = val;
    me.get = compile(val);
    if(me.callback) me.callback();
  }
  get_string = func me.string;
  
    o.props.foo = Property.new(type);
  or simply
    o.add_prop(name,type,...);

* many props is only graphical, they should have callback: func o.redraw().
  perhaps make ASObject.add_obj_prop_gfx() to avoid repeating this each time?

* let update_geometry be able to set a me.xofs so that objects can begin
  visually before their start time. could be used for value scales and such..

* allow non-temporal objects to be positioned before time 0, like global code
  and csound ftables and comments. this could function as a first page of the
  score, before time starts.. Simply put one or more page-marks before time 0!

* ASPlotObj crashes with "The application '<unknown>' lost its connection
  to the display :0.0; most likely the X server was shut down or you
  killed/destroyed the application." if there's too much data to be plotted,
  we need to get min/max on each pixel instead of plotting each value..

* the zoom isn't working well with long scores, each step makes too big
  difference. Also it's very slow.

* normalized playback of audio busses? remember last value and update when
  update() finished?

* playbus export dialog
- rate: label (from jack)
- channels: label (from bus nports)
- cancel button
  perhaps allow flexible mapping between busses/ports and soundfile channels,
  for splitting/merging?

* 3D plot of wave terrain synthesis

* reduce datasize of ftable graphs, to screen_width values or less.
  either skip values or find min/max in each...
  re-implement how they are stored, store graphs in the csound objects instead,
  and make sure they're deleted when they should.

* print to file:
- default filename to project filename if any, this needs re-design
  of where the current project filename is held... it should probably
  be held in the score, and set by opensave.nas...
- alt. palette file
- clip object

* do a more powerful linseg shape class that can do both single and double (mask)
  shapes? and maybe multiple lines.. should be supported directly in ASPlotObj?

* value grids in ASPlotObj, one mode where the whole scale is divided in N grids,
  but also one where only existing nodes get a grid, eventually also one where
  each grid is only drawn around individual nodes?
  a problem is to place the label so it won't collide with the curve..

* container objekt, kan användas till speciell value-grid objekt..
  alla ASPlotObj som finns i detta obj positioneras automatiskt enligt
  grid skalan, (height och ypos). skalans min/max uppdateras eventuellt enligt
  de objekt som finns där i.
  en toggle i GUI kan välja om man ska komma åt container objs eller vanliga
  objs, om man inte löser det på annat sätt?
  
* Playmode: audiobusses or pre-rendered file (för lyssningspartitur), or option to
  keep rendered temp-files and use exported file if any?

* palette/style editor GUI, där man kan ställa in färger, linjestilar, etc..
  och spara/ladda till filer samt välja aktuell palette.

* flytta ghost_init grejjorna från duplicate() och init() till en init_base()...

* låt DataGen visa sina events på sin linje, samt göra alignmentpoints..

* det kan faktiskt finnas en poäng med connections mellan ej-samtida objekt!
något i ett objekt kan påverka ett senare...
t.ex slutet av ett objekt ska "fortsättas" på något sätt i ett annat.
(t.ex csound tied notes?)

* Interaktivt linseg objekt

* Repeater object
repeterar inkommande data/events, markerar loop-punkterna på sin linje..
kan ha ingångar för att hoppa i loopen eller ändra dess längd, etc..  

* låt TimeGrid ge ut intervall-värdet (rate) vid t.

* optimera draw i PlotObj
läs datat i chunks så att varje chunk motsvarar en pixelbredd,
ta peakvärdena (min/max) för datat i varje chunk,
om inzoomad så att ett datavärde tar mer plats än en pixel, rita linje mellan
värdena och skippa ovanstående min/max grej...

rita endast data inom synligt område (ofs -> ofs+width)

* kan vissa rit-rutiner flyttas till C? t.ex draw_score()...
låt i så fall signal-kopplingen ske i C till canvas expose, så behöver det inte gå via
nasal kod alls. även andra saker som ASPlotObj.draw kan skrivas i C...
registrera då färgpaletten med C, kanske kan vi bara ha pekare
till färg-vektorerna? eller så använder vi naVec_get() som vanligt..

* ignorera objekt utanför synligt vertikalt område, men
rita deras connections ändå om de kommer från ett synligt objekt.

* andra förbättringar med ritandet och liknande, t.ex är det ganska slött
om man har väldigt många objekt! fundera på optimeringar. kanske sortera objekt
på smarta sätt, t.ex "endast synliga", osv.. fundera på vad som kan flyttas till C.

minimera alla linjära sökanden i objekt-listan (väldigt många nu...)

* send/recv fungerar ej med get_event()...

* undo
spara projektfilen i tempfil bakåt i tiden efter varje action?
som snapshots, märkta med tid.
inställning för antal snapshots...

* auto-clean temp-files at startup, list them and ask to delete them.

* reduced view mode, objekt med "hide_in_reduced_score=1" syns då ej,
kopplingar till och från detta objekt visas ej heller...
eller "hide_in_print".. och gör en print-view, där man ser sida för sida,
med title, composer, etc.. bättre lösning är kanske layers/tags?

* kopiera mellan projekt
vi behöver möjlighet att ha flera filer öppna samtidigt, t.ex med tabs?
vissa saker måste kanske flyttas från score_ui modulen till score klassen,
eller så låter vi score_ui_window vara en klass.. sedan behövs en clipboard.
eller öppna helt enkelt flera algoscore? och använd GtkClipboard.

* gör Functional baseclass, för sin, noise, etc...
hur göra freq in på en funktionell klass? vi räknar ju on-the-fly vid .get_value(t),
så om vi bara gör y = sin(t*f*2pi) så kommer ju fasen hoppa när vi ändrar frekvens...
är det överhuvudtaget möjligt? tror inte det.. hur ska vi veta fasen vid en random
tidpunkt om den beror på hur frekvensen förändrats tidigare?
Detta hade varit annorlunda om varje objekt alstrade hela sitt data på en gång,
och att mottagaren ber om upplösningen...

eller räcker det bara genom att försäkra att läsning sker i rätt ordning? då kan objektet
scanna igenom tiden (med cache) och reagera på inkommande frekvensdata, men utan att skriva
något data. ska denna scanning ske i ett visst intervall, eller med det intervall som ges
av con.get_event(i)? vad händer då med interpolerande indata?
vad händer om vi samplar en gång per sinuscykel? borde inte det vara bra?
T.ex: vi har en ramp som går från f1 till f2 under första halvan av ett sinusobjekt och
som styr dess frekvens. vilken skillnad på fasen under andra halvan av sinusen blir det
beroende på hur ofta rampen samplas i första halvan??

nej, vi kommer inte runt att vi måste ha en upplösning... om det ska lösas matematiskt så
går det bara om varje sändar-objekt ger ut en metod för att få integralen/arean av datat hos
objektet, och det känns lite overkill...

däremot behöver vi inte lagra datat som en samplelista, vi kan scanna (med cache) efter tidpunkten
som efterfrågas och returnera endast det värdet.

* event format och typsystem
standardisera att events alltid är 2 elements vektor? eller tvärtom, uppmuntra att
flera parametrar läggs i event efter t? i så fall, låt get_value(t) returnera
subvec(ev,1), och con.get_event(i) gör ev~=[]; ev[0]+=ofs;
nackdelen med detta är att get_value(t) returnerar en 1-elements lista när vi
i vanliga fall förväntar oss ett enkelt värde precis som med samplebased data..
så i så fall är det nästan bättre att vi returnerar första elementet endast.
fast det känns lite knäppt att det är olika sorts data man får med get_value() och
get_event()... alltså, säg att vi har en multichannel-kurva (t.ex min/max
klusternotation), då förväntar man sig en lista på två värden både från get_event() och
get_value()..

detta kanske bäst ska lösas med ett typsystem, där typer kan ärva av varandra och
konverteras mellan varandra... liknande GObjects typsystem.
låt i så fall varje outlet ha en type..

ska events (eller alla värden??) vara hashtables istället? t.ex {time:t,value:v,freq:f,amp:a}
så att konvertering mellan typer är lättare? en subtyp har då kvar samma symboler som sin föräldertyp,
men kan utöka med egna symboler, etc... man kan t.o.m använda nasals arv med parents[], varvid man
inte behöver kopiera symboler till subtyper, samt kan rekursera genom parent-trädet för att få
veta bastyper av en typ, etc..
dock vill man ju att den enklaste "value" ska kunna förstå t.ex en midi-nots "pitch", och alltså
göra value=pitch... hade varit bra med nån slags alias-system då...

men bra t.ex för alla sorts events som har en duration, då använder de "duration" och
alla som är intresserad av en events duration kan få denna...
t.ex EvGraph kan defaulta till "duration" för att välja event längder, men i props
så får man en meny på alla fält i inkommande event-typ? fast det kan ju vara olika
på olika connections... 

kan antagligen bli väldigt elegant, men nackdelen är att varje värde som skickas måste bli en
hashtab även när det handlar om ett enkelt litet värde... dock behöver det ju inte lagras som sådant,
detta kan göras i get_value/get_event, etc..
dessutom kanske enkel-värden kan specialbehandlas och skickas som sådant?

men som det är nu, kanske låt events ha extra parms direkt i event vektorn, och låt
get_value() returnera första värdet. t.ex om vi har ett line-objekt med curve parameter
på varje event, så vill vi ju ändå att get_value() ska returnera det faktiskt värdet och
ignorera curve parametern! fast samtidigt, en min/max kluster-kurva vill ju ge ut
båda värdena... kanske är det bra att ha både och? det faktiska ut-värdet som ev[1] vare sig
det är ett tal eller en lista av tal, och ev[1+N] för extra-parametrar som behöver lagras med
event med som ej ska ges ut med get_value()?

* insert för y-led

* caption_xofs och caption_yofs för att rita caption inne i obj?

* rita grids i separat surface
och bara painta denna i expose...
behöver inte ens ritas om vid scroll, bara paint med offset modulo gridsize...

* möjlighet att flytta en con till annat dest-obj...

* generell event-viewer
mappning sker till vad parametrarna betyder:
- length
- ypos
- density
- print above event
- color
- dot size
- line width
stöd även för "percussion" events (utan duration)

* AudioBus
----------
skapa tmpfil om src ej har audiobuf.

export

Mixning av flera inlets?
Antingen låter vi flera bussar dela på samma port, varvid vi behöver en global port-lista
som varje bus refererar till...
Eller så flyttar vi region-listan till bus->tracks[],
for each bus:
  out = 0;
  for each track:
    for each region:
      out += sample
Samtidigt så mixar ju jack automagiskt flera portar som kopplats till samma destination...

Regions:
--------
region->amp,
region->ofs,
region->length, som klipps till file length..

libsndfile har funktioner för att hantera normalization och peak-chunks i float format.
t.ex ha normalize toggle vid export och uppspelning, samt länkar mellan varje buss för
hur de ska grupperas vid normalisering (om man vill bibehålla balans mellan bussar/kanaler)

hur göra med samplerate? ska varje audiobus ha individuell samplerate och sen gör vi
conversion med libsamplerate vid uppspelning/export, eller ska vi helt enkelt ha en
global samplerate? och se till att csound har samma (csoundGetSampleRate())...
såhär: audiobussarna har en samplerate som används vid:
- skapande av egna bufferfiler
- export till fil
- om källan har en buffer med annan SR så görs on-the-fly SRC vid export och uppspelning
uppspelning gör SRC om jack ej kör samma SR som bussen...

MidiBus
-------
export

auto note off vid stop

flera kanaler i samma buss?

testa 14 bit CC.. (t.ex mod:1001)

Bestäm ett midi-liknande eventformat som används, så kan det även exporteras till
textfil för uppspelning/bearbetning av separata program, eller inläsning till audioscore
igen, etc... (t.ex konvertering till lilypond) ?

Fundera på hur man kan representera rytm på ett alternativt sätt, t.ex som proportioner
eller delningar, så att export till noter inte behöver krångla till det med kvantisering
och detektering av multoler! fast detta kanske ska ske i andra objekt än MidiBus?

* csound
--------
låt tag-räknaren vara per instrument?

gör per-event inlets:
setInputValueCallback(), C-callback anropar nasal-callback i csound-obj,
som i sin tur anropar cs_get_invalue(t) i rätt event-objekt, där t är current
score time. obj.cs_get_invalue() gör sedan get_value(t)...
man kan också skapa per-event software channels, men det kan bli rätt många..

gör inlets/outlets för både kontroll och audio,
även för standard audio outputs, vilka läses från tmpfilen..

tryck 'e' för att öppna orc fil i texteditor! om ingen orc fil var specificerad, skapa
en ny (fråga var den ska spara)... (gör generell texteditor)

visa distortion med röda markeringar på csound objektet? behöver kanske parsa
log-output från csound tyvärr... åtminstonde gör hela csound-bussen röd om distortion skett.

kom på något snyggt stöd för tied notes?
(neg p3 = hold, neg p1 = note off, p1 fraction = tag)
t.ex rita bågar mellan cs_events, detta kräver stöd för att låta objekt rita fritt
i partituret, t.ex genom en obj.draw_in_score() eller liknande.
men då skulle man vilja göra kopplingarna grafiskt, kan man lösa detta genom att generalisera
connections? alltså att ha en mer generell "object relation" varav connections är en sort.
kan göras med samma meny som connections, så för användaren ser det ut som speciella in/ut-gångar...

fixa config options för csound, eller räcker det bara med
./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/csound/headers -L/path/to/csound/lib"
eller CFLAGS="-framework CsoundLib" ??

* möjlighet att ändra i klasskod och uppdatera objekt av den klassen..
"reload classes" finns nu på menyn. men hur göra för att uppdatera objekten?
kan man bara byta ut obj.parents? nej, vi måste göra motsvarande save och load..
så att t.ex saker i class.init() utförs...
helt enkelt, återskapa objektet och dess props, kopplingar, links, etc..
antingen har vi ett kommando för att göra detta med objektet under pekaren,
fast bättre vore att "reload classes" ser vilka filer som ändrats och uppdaterar
alla obj med klasser från den filen.

även möjlighet att byta ut ett objekt mot ett nytt obj av annan klass, och
kopiera över de gemensamma properties, och connections.

* anropa obj.update_unused_regions() i obj.update()?

* ghost copies
- highlight parent
- egen length?
- kanske en lista på vilka props som ska vara egna o vilka som ska tas från
  parent...

* props kan ha en "widget" som då används istället för GtkEntry i propbox...
man kan också ha en "type" som kan vara:
- code entry
- string entry
- toggle
- menu
- button (anropar callback)
- widget (använd annan widget)
eller kan vi använda optbox? eller slå ihop dessa..
skillnaden är att propbox bara registrerar get/set metoder, medan optbox arbetar
med en lista på options med name,label,value,etc...
sen har vi ytterligare en, i prefs_ui! borde verkligen slå ihop dessa så att alla tre
kan använda samma ramverk för types och widgets, etc..
man kan ha samma kod i botten..

* dokumentation!

* edit mode kanske ska göras som en action?

* auto-scroll när man drar utanför skärmen...
vid objmove, conmove, connection och align/link.
fungerar inte än!

* globals
förutom att de kan användas i kod så vill man t.ex kunna ange det som
värde på en property. men att bara skriva "G_get('foo')" byter ut värdet och
kommer sedan inte uppdatera propertien om variabeln ändras...
kan man ha en toggle bredvid varje prop i prop-editor där man kan
välja om det som matats in är ett värde eller en globals symbol?

* transformations
gör genom vanliga objekt (som då måste veta hur den ska transformera den typ av
värde som inkommer) eller speciella objekt som ritas mellan två andra objekt och
vet vilka ingångspar som ska användas, etc... och använder objektens egna metoder
för transformation. kanske bara tillåta transform mellan två obj av samma klass?? 
annars är frågan vilket av objektens transform() metod som ska användas!

skulle kunna göras som en underklass av "generell objekt-relation" tillsammans med
tied notes och vanliga connections?

även här kanske ett typsystem kommer in i bilden?

gör som ett vanligt objekt, men vi kan fortfarande använda sändarobjektens egna
morf-metoder. problemet med detta är att objekten måste komma från samma basklass
för att det ska fungera? men man vill ju t.ex kunna morfa mellan en sample-sekvens från
ett noise objekt och en event-sekvens från en funktion, etc..
så det har snarare att göra med typer:
- numeriskt värde
- listor av numeriska värden
- listor av listor av numeriska värden
- etc..

och det kan finnas egenskaper hos morfningen, t.ex kvantisering av värden och olika metoder
att transformera mellan två listor, etc..

* selections för:
- move
- copy
- delete
- connect (visa gemensam lista av utgångar)
- props (props med olika värden i olika objs markeras visuellt)
current selection ska även gå att klippa in i console-fönstret som en lista
på obj-id's... 
gör även ett flexibelt match (and transform?) fönster där objekt kan selekteras
utifrån property, classname, start, length, ypos, etc..
transform-funktioner ska finnas i dynamiskt bibliotek, så att man kan lägga till egna, etc..

* bättre möjligheter att hantera ett partitur numeriskt,
t.ex köra egna scripts,
inbyggd texteditor för dessa,
hjälp-funktioner för att selektera och transformera objekt på olika sätt...

* connection fields
visas som en ram, alla objekt som befinner sig i ramen kopplas automatiskt enligt hur
ramen är kopplad till mottagare... när man kopplar ramen så visas outlet-lista enligt
vilka utgångar som finns hos objekten inom ramen.
när ett objekt flyttas in i ramen så görs connection, flyttas ut görs disconnect.
de enskilda kopplingarna från alla objekt i ramen visas ej (i score_ui: om obj ingår
i connection group, don't draw connection)

* optional arg till con.get_event(), inlet.val_finder() eller inlet.get_connections()
(eller property av inlet!)
för att klippa events som är utanför området istället för att ignorera dem.
interpolating data ska klippas med obj.interpolate(a,b,x)...

* options för att fylla hål med närmaste source value eller givet default value?
kan t.ex vara ett opt arg till con.get_value()! (eller property av inlet?)
särskilt hålet innan första connection kan vara viktigt...

* cache i obj.get_value(t)... events kan använda binsearch

* gör en event_bindings, lista på:
toolmode, modifiers, key/button, callback, description
antingen 2D hash: event_bindings[keybutton][modifier]
eller event_bindings[modifier~keybutton]...
"btn"~ev.button för musknappar, bara ev.keyval_name för tangenter
men modifier bör kunna vara en lista eller wildcard...

visa vad musknapparna gör med aktuellt nedtryckta modifiers i statusraden
t.ex alignment: 1: align 2: pan 3: link
alignment: 1: resize-align 2: pan 3: resize-link

* links
att flytta en länk mellan två obj där me.obj ingår i en grupp med fler objekt beteer sig
lite underligt, hela gruppen flyttas till den nya länken precis som när man re-alignar ett
objekt till en egen alignment point.
kanske ska man göra såhär: ta bort länken, gör align, återskapa länken...

ibland verkar logiken brista när man hanterar länkar mellan redan befintliga grupper o liknande.
t.ex att fel objekt flyttas, etc..

t.ex när en länk flyttas från början av två objs till end, då flyttas båda objs!

att ändra längden på ett objekt där slutet är länkat till början eller slutet av ett annat obj
borde flytta/ändra längd på det andra obj... 

* rita connections som är utanför scrollwindow för synliga objekt?
frågan är hur man undviker överlappningar...

* placera connections i den synliga delen av objekten vid space search
flytta place_connection till score_ui?

* stretch, t.ex Ctrl-Alt-drag...
obj.move_resize_done(m,r) anropar obj.stretched(f) om r==2..
f är faktor jämfört med förra storleken... (vi behöver alltså
låta move_resize_done() spara förra storleken)
default methods: 
- ändra resolution för sample outlets
- multiplicera dt's för event outlets

* implementera maskning för överlapp i y-led ?
högre ypos ger företräde (oberoende av destobjs ypos)
skall påverka inlet.get_connections() (varje con's start/length)
samt obj.update_unused_regions()...

* csound orc file frontend??
grafiskt patch ritas, orc fil skapas!
många opcodes kan ha grafiska symboler,
andra saker ritas som generell låda med opkod namn och in och utgångar i ordning...
matematiska uttryck ritas på samma sätt..
